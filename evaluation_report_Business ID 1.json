      "Question": "What are some of the challenges in building LLM-powered autonomous agents, as discussed in the provided text?",
      "SmartAI Ans": "Based on the provided text, challenges in building LLM-powered autonomous agents include:\n\n1.  **Finite context length:** The limited context window restricts the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses.  This limits the ability of mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes. While vector stores can help, their representation power isn't as strong as full attention.\n\n2.  **Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition:**  Planning over extended periods and effectively exploring the solution space are difficult. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when unexpected errors occur, making them less robust than humans.\n\n3.  **Reliability of natural language interface:** The reliance on natural language as an interface between LLMs and other components (memory, tools) is problematic because LLMs can make formatting errors or exhibit unexpected behavior (e.g., refusing instructions).  This necessitates significant parsing of model output in agent code.\n",
      "Actual Ans": "Challenges include the finite context length of LLMs, which limits the amount of historical information and instructions that can be included; difficulties in long-term planning and task decomposition; and the unreliability of LLM outputs, which requires significant effort in parsing and error handling.",

      "Actual Ans": "API-Bank is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It assesses the ability of LLMs to call APIs correctly, retrieve relevant APIs, and plan sequences of API calls to solve complex tasks.",
